    <!-- Description of the book -->
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Description:-</h4></li>
      <p>The “Flight Plan: How to Achieve More, Faster Than You Ever Dreamed Possible” is a great book for anyone who is really trying to better their time management skills. Brian Tracy is the author of this book. In this book, excellent strategies for mastering productivity & eliminating procrastination is discussed. This book is much more about “best practices” for productivity vs overcoming procrastination. It’s a quick read on fundamental principles of time-management. Clearly laid-out for quick reading and referenceThe book argues that the key to success is to overcome procrastination by concentrating single-mindedly on your most important task and to get that task done both quickly and well. This can only be done by acknowledging the very things you most dread doing that day and doing them first, thereby, overcoming procrastination and helping you feel positively empowered. In other words, all things being equal, if having to eat a live frog is the worst thing you have to do in a given day, it’s usually better to eat that frog before you do anything else. The “frog” in this case is a metaphor for the most important (and often most unpleasant/dreaded) task facing you..</p>
